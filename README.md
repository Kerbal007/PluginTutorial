Plugin Tutorial for Kerbal Space Program

This is my attempt at following a tutorial I found on youtube for modding parts in KSP.
I have basically cloned a part, removed all functionality of it and created a popup gui window that loads if the part is 
connected to the active vessel.

we then enabled it to work if multiple of the same part are connected to the active vessel and to fail over to the next part
should the first no longer work.
Code was added to allow the window position to be saved to the last location you left it at when you enter and exit the game
however the config file that is created to store this info does not appear to be saving the window postition values at present.

That's all I have time for for now.
